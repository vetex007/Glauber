  <h1>Historical Background of the Glauber Model</h1>

  <p>
    The Glauber model was originally formulated in the late 1950s by Roy J. Glauber
    in the context of quantum multiple-scattering theory. Its initial purpose was
    to describe high-energy scattering processes involving composite systems,
    where multiple interactions between constituents occur.
  </p>

  <p>
    As nuclear and particle physics experiments progressed to higher energies,
    the Glauber framework was adapted to describe collisions between atomic
    nuclei. At sufficiently high energies, the wavelengths associated with the
    interacting particles become small compared to nuclear dimensions, allowing
    the collision process to be treated using geometric and probabilistic methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the emergence of relativistic heavy-ion programs, the Glauber model
    became an indispensable tool for estimating the initial overlap geometry of
    nuclear collisions. Early implementations relied on smooth nuclear density
    profiles, giving rise to the so-called <em>optical Glauber model</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later developments introduced event-by-event fluctuations by explicitly
    sampling individual nucleon positions inside nuclei. These Monte Carlo
    implementations capture realistic variations in participant numbers and
    collision geometry, which are crucial for understanding flow phenomena and
    other fluctuation-driven observables in heavy-ion collisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern Monte Carlo Glauber models form the foundation of initial condition
    generators used in hydrodynamic simulations. Among these, GLISSANDO&nbsp;3
    provides a flexible and well-tested framework incorporating nucleon
    fluctuations, sub-nucleonic structure, and various modeling options.
