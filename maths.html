  <h1>Mathematical Framework of the Glauber Model</h1>

  <p>
    In the Glauber model, atomic nuclei are treated as collections of nucleons
    whose spatial distribution follows a nuclear density profile. For medium
    and heavy nuclei, the Woods–Saxon distribution is commonly employed:
  </p>

  <p class="equation">
    ρ(r) = ρ<sub>0</sub> / [1 + exp((r − R)/a)]
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, <em>R</em> represents the nuclear radius, <em>a</em> is the surface
    diffuseness parameter, and ρ<sub>0</sub> is the central nuclear density. This
    form reflects an approximately constant density in the nuclear interior with
    a smooth falloff at the surface.
  </p>

  <p>
    At ultra-relativistic energies, nucleons are assumed to travel along
    straight-line trajectories. A nucleon–nucleon collision occurs when the
    transverse distance between two nucleons from different nuclei satisfies:
  </p>

  <p class="equation">
    d<sub>T</sub> ≤ √(σ<sub>NN</sub> / π)
  </p>

  <p>
    where σ<sub>NN</sub> denotes the inelastic nucleon–nucleon cross section at
    the given collision energy. This geometric criterion determines whether an
    inelastic interaction takes place.
  </p>

  <p>
    The number of participating nucleons, denoted as
    <em>N<sub>part</sub></em>, corresponds to nucleons that undergo at least one
    inelastic collision. The number of binary collisions,
    <em>N<sub>coll</sub></em>, counts the total number of individual
    nucleon–nucleon interactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    These quantities form the basis for centrality determination and scaling
    relations in heavy-ion collisions and serve as essential inputs to
    hydrodynamic and transport models.
