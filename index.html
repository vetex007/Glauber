  <h2>Introduction and Physics Motivation</h2>

  <p>
    Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions produce the most complex many-body
    systems accessible in laboratory experiments. When two heavy nuclei collide
    at high energies, thousands of particles are created within a tiny spacetime
    volume, forming strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of
    temperature and energy density.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interaction,
    predicts that such conditions lead to the formation of a deconfined state of
    quarks and gluons known as the <strong>Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP)</strong>.
    Experimental programs at RHIC and the LHC aim to characterize this medium and
    understand its dynamical properties.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Geometry Matters in Heavy-Ion Collisions</h2>

  <p>
    Unlike elementary proton–proton collisions, nucleus–nucleus interactions are
    intrinsically geometric. Each nucleus is an extended object composed of many
    nucleons, and the outcome of a collision depends sensitively on how these
    nucleons overlap in space.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of nucleons that actually interact varies event by event</li>
    <li>The collision overlap region can be circular or highly deformed</li>
    <li>Fluctuations in geometry directly affect final-state observables</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Since the impact parameter and nucleon-level configuration cannot be measured
    directly, theoretical modeling is required to connect experimental observables
    to the underlying collision geometry.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>From Measured Signals to Physical Quantities</h2>

  <p>
    Experiments measure quantities such as charged-particle multiplicity,
    transverse energy, and spectator nucleon energy. These observables are
    monotonically related to the collision geometry but do not uniquely determine
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    To interpret the data, one introduces geometric quantities that characterize
    the collision:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>N<sub>part</sub></strong> — number of participating nucleons</li>
    <li><strong>N<sub>coll</sub></strong> — number of binary nucleon–nucleon collisions</li>
    <li><strong>b</strong> — impact parameter</li>
    <li><strong>ε<sub>n</sub></strong> — initial-state spatial eccentricities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These quantities form the backbone of centrality determination and scaling
    relations used throughout heavy-ion phenomenology.
  </p>

  <h2>Role of the Glauber Model</h2>

  <p>
    The Glauber model provides a probabilistic framework to estimate collision
    geometry based on nuclear density distributions and the inelastic
    nucleon–nucleon cross section. It translates an unobservable microscopic
    configuration into experimentally useful geometric quantities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over several decades, the Glauber model has evolved from a quantum mechanical
    scattering formalism into a practical and robust tool used by all major
    heavy-ion experiments.
  </p>

  <h2>From Glauber Geometry to Modern Simulations</h2>

  <p>
    Modern analyses require event-by-event modeling of the initial geometry,
    including fluctuations in nucleon positions and energy deposition. This has
    motivated the widespread adoption of Monte Carlo implementations of the
    Glauber model.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this work, we focus on <strong>GLISSANDO&nbsp;3</strong>, a modern Monte Carlo
    Glauber framework that incorporates realistic nuclear densities, fluctuating
    sources, and flexible modeling options. It serves as a bridge between
    fundamental geometry and state-of-the-art heavy-ion simulations.
