  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a unique laboratory for
    studying strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature
    and energy density. At sufficiently high energies, Quantum Chromodynamics
    (QCD) predicts the formation of a deconfined state of quarks and gluons,
    commonly referred to as the <strong>Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP)</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Experiments at modern particle accelerators collide heavy nuclei at
    ultra-relativistic energies, creating systems that briefly reach conditions
    similar to those believed to have existed in the early universe. The
    properties of the produced medium are inferred indirectly through final-state
    observables such as particle multiplicities, collective flow, and quarkonium
    production.
  </p>

  <p>
    A precise understanding of the initial geometry of nuclear collisions is
    essential for interpreting these observables. Since the early stages of the
    collision are not directly accessible experimentally, theoretical models
    play a crucial role. Among these, the <strong>Glauber model</strong> has become
    a standard framework for estimating the collision geometry and the number of
    interacting nucleons.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this documentation, we present a detailed discussion of the Glauber model,
    its historical development, mathematical formulation, and its practical
    implementation using the Monte Carlo event generator
    <strong>GLISSANDO&nbsp;3</strong>. The aim is to provide a clear and structured
    reference for understanding Glauber-based simulations in heavy-ion physics.
